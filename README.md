# The adventures of Blocky-Witcher

## Description
Hello! Welcome to my game making workplace. I am learning to make a game with javafx. I am a student in computer science and this will be my annual project this year. Have a look around and if you have any feedback or tips, they are always welcome!

Week 1 - I made a loader for the tiles and textures to display the first level of the game. This loader is universal for every map i will make.

Week 2 - Player movement, I had some struggle with the class structure stuff so this week I finished the ability for the player to walk their witcher around!

Week 3 - Hitboxes and Collision stuff! this week I made an extra layer in my map for collision purposes. This layer isn't visible and will act as an area not to go. I made an collision controller which possesses the list of objects with a bound, all of these bounds are checked to make sure there is no colliding. If there is the player will be placed to the previous set location, handy stuff!
